                Hello Kaila, I've made this website for us, for our relationship. For the future of us, the 2 years of us being together has been really fun, it gave me the joy, the smile, and the happiness that I didn't receive ever in my life. You were the person that made me laugh hysterically without anyone seeing the side of me, you were the only person to give me love that I never felt in my entire life, even from my parents. I am really grateful of you that you came into my life, I am blessed by God for blessing me the greatest gift that I have ever received.
            </p>

            <p class="letter-paragraph">
                Our relationship have been rough, yes it can be exhausting at some points as time passes, it can be sad, happy, or even angry at some point, but that was never a hurdle for the both of us, we kept on striving for the better good. 2 years, ahh, it feels like heaven having to spend these times that have passed with you, it is really a gift you can be really grateful of, you are the embodiment of the most precious gift (only for me of course, hehe). Even if we have our misunderstandings, conflicts, arguments, we must try and try until we eventually succeed, at some point in time God will always provide our needs for the both of us, patience is the key for this. I didn't regret a single day of my life spending my time with you, it was never a waste but it was a gift, even seconds cannot be taken for granted, every second must be held like a precious diamond, with care and of course with love. I would spend my whole time with you, counting the minimals of seconds with you rather than doing unnecessary stuff that isn't connected with you. I would cherish each second, nanosecond, millisecond like a dime that is very important. You are my four leaf clover, my lucky one, my charm, my love, my everything, my precious, my wife, my only one. You colored my dul life book into an alive and vivid book that bloomed bright colors. I love you with all my heart and that will never change, my love for you is eternal and forever. I love you with all of my heart! 🌹💞

            <h2 class="apology-title">An Apology From the Deepest Depths of my Heart, Soul, and Humanity</h2>

            <p class="apology-paragraph">
                Hello Kaila! I am not writing this letter as a form of having "makaawa" towards you but I am writing this letter from what I feel, from the deepest depths of my heart, soul and humanity. It's been a rough ride lately, I know it. We sometimes get tired, exhausted, and stressed. From the perspective of being couples, basically we are "locked" to each other having minimal freedom. We are like waves in this relationship, sometimes crashing, sometimes stable. It's like a rollercoaster of events. I am really sorry for the inactions that I have committed through our relationship, (also including when we were not official yet, and I deeply regret all of the things that I did towards you that cause you pain). It's shame for me to say that I even consider myself as a man when I hurt the one that I love the most (you). I am deeply regretting the actions that I have made and committed towards you, all of it wans't intentional rather I have the temper of my dad, very very short tempered, but I am willing to change a be a new person for you just give me the final go signal, even if it alters my whole personality and humanity just to be with you again, I will do it. As the final act. All wasn't intentional but was brought up by my pent up emotions, I think it was called as "emotional dysregulation" or having the "impossible" control of your emotions to the point irrational decisions are made. I will change for you and alter my whole attitude for u. I will be calmer, I will be quieter, I will be rational of my decisions especially when times I feel an emotional burst inside me. It was all unintentional, it wasn't out of choice but out of impulsivity caused by emotions. I am willing to change for you, even if I say this a 100 times, I am willing, willing, willing. I will not give up on you nor myself, until I become a whole new person even if it kills my negative side.
            </p>

            <p class="apology-paragraph">
                To the part, we were sweet lovers, to terror enemies (constant fights). I will make a change of that, for the both of us to benefit on the way of our relationship. I am committed to you the whole commitment is within me, my heart seeking for you only and always be. The deepest pains that you feel I will heal that and making it as shallow as the seashore. I am sorry for everything that I shown you, the negativity, the everything that hurted you. I just want you I don't want no one, but only you to be my partner for my whole life. I will give some real realistic efforts towards my emotional and mental change, I will be more positive in our relationship and will avoid negativity and things that might kill our relationship. I will avoid things that hinder our relationship to the point that I will be your shield protecting you from things that will hurt you, even if it means that I will protect you from myself, I will do it, I am committed and dedicated to do all of that for you, for us. My words seem to be redundant and always repetitive, but this is a sign and will be a mark for a drastic change for the both of us, for our relationship and our future.  
            </p>

            <p class="apology-paragraph">
                This apology letter towards you isn't a letter to instantly fix our problem between us, but its an assurance that I really really recognize the mistake that I have done and eventually reflecting on them. Assuring you that these words are the final act. I will do my very and absolute best to commit on these words that I have place, I will succeed for you, for us, and for our relationship I am sorry po my love, Kaila.
            </p>
